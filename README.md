# File Sharing Platform

A secure file sharing platform built with Next.js and Supabase, featuring user authentication, file encryption, and access control.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- A Supabase account (for database and authentication)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Amar585/File_Share.git
cd file-sharing-platform
```

### 2. Supabase Setup

1. Create a new project at [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Once your project is created, go to Project Settings > API to get your:
   - Project URL
   - anon/public key
   - service_role key (for migrations)

### 3. Environment Configuration

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Email Configuration (Optional - for email verification)
SMTP_HOST=your_smtp_host
SMTP_PORT=your_smtp_port
SMTP_USER=your_smtp_username
SMTP_PASS=your_smtp_password
SENDER_EMAIL=your_sender_email
```

### 4. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 5. Database Setup

The project uses Supabase migrations to set up the database schema. Run the following command to execute the migrations:

```bash
node run-migration.js
```

### 6. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

- Regular backups of the database are recommended
- Monitor file storage usage in your Supabase dashboard
