# Email Verification Guide for File Sharing Platform

This guide explains the email verification flow implemented in the File Sharing Platform, focusing on the changes made to fix previous email delivery and authentication issues.

## Overview of the Solution

The email verification system has been improved to:

1. Use Supabase's built-in email delivery methods (magic link and invite link) which are more reliable
2. Provide a better user experience during the verification process
3. Handle unverified users more gracefully
4. Allow resending verification emails when needed

## How Email Verification Works

When a user signs up:

1. The user enters their email, password, and username on the signup page
2. The system registers the user with `email_confirm: false`
3. Supabase sends a verification email using its built-in delivery system
4. The user is shown a verification page with instructions
5. When the user clicks the verification link in their email, they're redirected to the signin page with a success message
6. The user can then sign in with their verified credentials

## Components and Pages

### 1. Components

- **VerificationAlert**: A versatile component for displaying verification status (pending, verified, error) with options to resend verification emails.

### 2. Pages

- **Signup Page**: Collects user information and triggers registration through the admin API endpoint.
- **Verification Page**: Displays instructions for email verification and allows resending the verification email.
- **Signin Page**: Handles login attempts and provides options for unverified users to resend verification emails.

### 3. API Routes

- **/api/auth/admin-register**: Server-side registration endpoint that creates users and sends verification emails.
- **/api/auth/resend-verification**: Endpoint for resending verification emails.
- **/auth/callback**: Processes verification links and redirects users appropriately.

## Troubleshooting

If users report not receiving verification emails:

1. Check Supabase dashboard for email sending errors
2. Verify that the Site URL is set correctly in Supabase project settings
3. Remember that free tier Supabase projects have a limit of 4 emails/hour
4. Instruct users to check their spam/junk folders

## Supabase Email Configuration

Email sending is being handled by Supabase's built-in email service. No custom SMTP configuration is needed in the code, as we're leveraging Supabase's email delivery capabilities.

The system tries two methods to send verification emails:
1. First, it attempts to send a magic link
2. If that fails, it falls back to sending an invite link

Both methods have been tested and work correctly with Supabase's email system.

## Technical Implementation Notes

- The cascade delete issue between `auth.users` and `public.profiles` has been fixed.
- The system has been designed to not require custom SMTP configurations.
- We've added better error handling for cases where users try to sign in without verifying their email.
- The UI provides clear feedback about verification status and next steps.

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements could include:
- Email templates customization through the Supabase dashboard
- Adding SMS verification as an alternative
- Implementing a verification expiry system
- Adding admin tools to manually verify user accounts
